#### **Research Question 3**: How can the findings enhance studentsâ€™ performance?

**Answer**:  
Educational institutions can:  
1. **Improve Resource Access**: Provide internet and learning materials to underprivileged students.  
2. **Support Programs**: Develop targeted programs for students with learning disabilities.  
3. **Inclusive Environments**: Foster environments that mitigate socio-cultural biases.  
Teachers can further personalize teaching methods based on individual needs and challenges.

### Limitations
1. **Dataset Bias**: The dataset simulates realistic scenarios but lacks sourcing from real institutions, which may introduce bias.  
2. **Regional Representation**: The dataset reflects a specific region, limiting its global applicability.  
3. **Temporal Scope**: The dataset doesn't account for changes over time, such as those caused by external disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.
